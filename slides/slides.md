# Migration guide from 2.7 to 3.0

---

# Deprecation

Deprecations in Spring Boot 2.x have been removed in this release

---

# Application properties migration

<v-clicks>

Few properties got renamed/removed

For an easy migration path use this:

```kotlin
runtime("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-properties-migrator")
```

Donâ€™t forget to remove the dependency after migration is done ;)

</v-clicks>

<!--
[click]

A few configuration properties were renamed/removed and developers need to update their application.properties/application.yaml accordingly.

[click]
[click]

To help you with that, Spring Boot provides a spring-boot-properties-migrator module. Once added as a dependency to your project, this will not only analyze your applicationâ€™s environment and print diagnostics at startup, but also temporarily migrate properties at runtime for you.

[click]

Once youâ€™re done with the migration, please make sure to remove this module from your projectâ€™s dependencies.

# Logging Date Format

<v-clicks>

Default logging date changed  
Now uses ISO-8601

New: yyyy-MM-ddâ€™Tâ€™HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX  
Old: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS

Env: LOG_DATEFORMAT_PATTERN  
Property: logging.pattern.dateformat

</v-clicks>

<!--
[click]

Logback and Log4j2 changed default logging date

[click]

T separates the date and time instead of a space character
timezone offset at the end

[click]

Can be restored with these properties.
-->

# Configuration properties

<v-clicks>

Extra annotation @ConstructingBinding is no longer needed at the type level

Now you can use @ConfigurationProperties without this additional annotation.

Can be removed from most classes.

Exception: multiple constructors

</v-clicks>

<!--
When a class or record has multiple constructors, it may still be used on a constructor to indicate which one should be used for property binding.
-->

<v-click>

```kotlin{all|1,3-10}
@ConfigurationProperties("product")
@ConstructorBinding
data class ServiceProperties(
    val devEnvironment: Boolean = false,
)
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

application.properties
```properties
product.devEnvironment=true
```

</v-click>
---

# spring.factories is no more

<v-clicks>

Was used to load Autoconfigurations

```kotlin
@Configuration
class MyAutoConfiguration {

    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnMissingBean
    fun myService(): MyService { ... }
}
```

spring.factories
```properties
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfigurationImportListener=\
    com.example.MyAutoConfiguration
```

Replacement:

```
src/main/reosources/META-INF/
spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports
```
</v-clicks>

# URL route matching

<v-clicks>

Trailing slash will not be automatically handled by spring

```kotlin
@GetMapping("/product")
```

```kotlin
@GetMapping("/product/")
```

Now only matches /product and not /product/ anymore

</v-clicks>

---

# URL route matching

Possible solutions:

<v-clicks>

```kotlin
@GetMapping("/some/greeting", "/some/greeting/")
```

```kotlin{6}
@Configuration
public class WebConfiguration implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void configurePathMatch(PathMatchConfigurer configurer) {
      configurer.setUseTrailingSlashMatch(true);
    }
}
```

# Coroutines

<v-clicks>

What are coroutines?

Lightweight / green threads that are quite cheap to spawn in comparison to java threads

Used for asynchrounously (interleaved) executing jobs not parallel (at the same time).

</v-clicks>


---

# Coroutines example 1/1

<v-clicks>

```kotlin
suspend fun doSomethingUsefulOne(): Int {
    delay(1000L) // pretend we are doing something useful here
    return 13
}

suspend fun doSomethingUsefulTwo(): Int {
    delay(1000L) // pretend we are doing something useful here, too
    return 29
}
```

```kotlin
val time = measureTimeMillis {
    val one = doSomethingUsefulOne()
    val two = doSomethingUsefulTwo()
    println("The answer is ${one + two}")
}
println("Completed in $time ms")
```

Guesses?

```kotlin
The answer is 42
Completed in 2017 ms
```
</v-clicks>

---

# Coroutines example 2/1

<v-clicks>

```kotlin
val time = measureTimeMillis {
    val one = async { doSomethingUsefulOne() }
    val two = async { doSomethingUsefulTwo() }
    println("The answer is ${one.await() + two.await()}")
}
println("Completed in $time ms")
```


Guesses again?

```kotlin
The answer is 42
Completed in 1017 ms
```

```kotlin{2-3}
val time = measureTimeMillis {
    val one = async { doSomethingUsefulOne() }
    val two = async { doSomethingUsefulTwo() }
    println("The answer is ${one.await() + two.await()}")
}
println("Completed in $time ms")
```

# Coroutine support in Spring Data

# GraalVM support

<v-clicks>

Convert service to native image

Fast startup

Less memory usage

Ahead of time compilation

Most spring boot apps work out of the box

</v-clicks>

<!--

Spring applications can be converted into native images

[click]
[click]


This can provide significant memory and startup-up performance improvement

[click]

As everything that is needed and analyzed at runtime will be done at compile time.

So there is a longer compile time but super fast startup and a lot less memory usage.

[click]

Most spring boot services by should work out of the box with native image.

And those that are not working you can give the compiler a little hint which reflections is going on.

Last Kotlin meetup there was a talk about GraalVM, if you're interested check it out.

# @SpringBootTest with Main Methods


<v-clicks>

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    // custom logic with was not testable before
    runApplication<Application>(*args)
}
```

```kotlin
@SpringBootTest(useMainMethod=ALWAYS)
class IntegrationTest { ... }
```

</v-clicks>

<!--
The @SpringBootTest annotation can now use the main of any discovered @SpringBootConfiguration class if itâ€™s available. This means that any custom SpringApplication configuration performed by your main method can now be picked up by tests.
To use the main method for a test set the useMainMethod attribute of @SpringBootTest to UseMainMethod.ALWAYS or UseMainMethod.WHEN_AVAILABLE.

# Problem+json


<v-clicks>

rfc7807 - Problem Details for HTTP APIs

Why?

To standardize error messages.

```http request
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Length: 118
Content-Type: application/problem+json
```
```json
{
    "detail": "Failed to read HTTP message",
    "instance": "/product",
    "status": 400,
    "title": "Bad Request",
    "type": "about:blank"
}
